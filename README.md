# Blogify
Blogify is a Node.js-based blogging platform built with Express, MongoDB, and EJS. It allows users to register, sign in, create blogs, upload images, and comment on posts. The app uses Mongoose models for user, blog, and comment management, and middleware for authentication. Views are rendered using EJS templates with partials for UI components.
